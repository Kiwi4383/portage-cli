# em mirrordist

`em mirrordist` — build/maintain a distfiles mirror

**Effect:** modifies state.

## Usage

```
em mirrordist [OPTIONS] [REPO]
```

## Arguments

* `[REPO]` — repos.conf name or path

  Defaults to the main repo (opposite default from `em regen`, which excludes it).

## Options

* `--repos-dir <DIR>` — Directory containing master repositories
* `--distfiles <DIR>` — Distfiles directory to populate
* `-j, --jobs <JOBS>` — Concurrent downloads
* `--delete` — Delete distfiles no longer referenced by any ebuild. Effect: destructive (may delete or irreversibly overwrite).
* `--deletion-delay <DURATION>` — Grace period before an orphaned file is deleted (e.g. `7d`, `72h`) \[default: 7d\]
* `--deletion-db <FILE>` — Deletion-grace state file (default: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/em/mirrordist/<repo>-*.json`)
* `--success-log <FILE>` — Tab-delimited log of fetched files (appended)
* `--failure-log <FILE>` — Tab-delimited log of fetch failures (appended)
* `--scheduled-deletion-log <FILE>` — Report of files scheduled for deletion, grouped by date (rewritten)
* `--whitelist-from <FILE>...` — File(s) listing distfile names --delete must never remove (one
  name per line, `#`-comments ignored).
* `--verify-existing-digest` — Re-hash already-present files instead of trusting their size
* `--gentoo-mirrors-fallback` — Also try GENTOO\_MIRRORS after the ebuild's own URIs (real
  emirrordist never does this — off by default).
* `--delete-allow-incomplete` — Allow --delete even when some ebuilds had no metadata cache entry
* `-p, --pretend` — Show what would be done without actually performing any actions
* `-h, --help` — Print help (see a summary with '-h')

## Roots

Which tree this invocation reads and writes.

* `--prefix <DIR>` — Unprivileged offset: ROOT/VDB/distfiles/build trees under DIR; config
  still from the host (use --root for a config offset).
* `--local [<DIR>]` — Unprivileged, standalone Gentoo-Prefix: own VDB/BROOT/config, not
  overlaid on the host (see --prefix for the overlay). Defaults to
  ~/.gentoo (EPREFIX=~/.gentoo) when no DIR is given (`--local=`).

  A bare `--local` takes the next word as DIR.
* `--config-root <PATH>` — Read config (profile, make.conf) from this root instead of `--root`
* `-T, --target <TARGET>` — Cross-build/setup for a crossdev target tuple, or a spec file describing one

  A value containing `/` or ending in `.toml` is a spec file, in the form
  `em crossdev --print-spec` prints; its `tuple` is the target.

  The single source for "which tuple" everywhere: `em crossdev --target T --init-target`
  sets T up; `em stages --target T --stage1` (or any plain atom build) resolves/installs
  into the target sysroot `<EROOT>/usr/<TUPLE>` — sugar for
  `--config-root <sysroot> --root <sysroot>`.

  Cross context (CHOST/CBUILD, `--root-deps=rdeps`) is read from the
  sysroot make.conf. One flag for both roles — `crossdev` no longer
  has its own `-t`/`--target`.
* `--root <PATH>` — Installation root (the offset an applet installs into / queries)

## Global options

* `--color <WHEN>` — \[default: auto\] \[possible values: auto, always, never\]
